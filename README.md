## Getting Started

Hello there! Thanks for being a contributor. Once you clone the project, create a branch with your GitHub username, and create a file (named your username) to that branch.

Also, change the test.txt file any way you like (besides the name or file type). Then merge your branch with the main branch. Then push your changes to GitHub. Good luck!
